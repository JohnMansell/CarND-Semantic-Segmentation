### Objective
> The goal of this project is to emulate the rusults from 
[Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211.pdf) by Shelhamer et al.
Their neural network was able to extend the pretrained vgg-16 model in order to add spatial information to the network.
Shelhamer et al. was able to achieve pixel by pixel classification of images. This project attempts to provide pixel by
pixel recognition of road / not-road pixels in a series of images taken from a car driving along the road.
